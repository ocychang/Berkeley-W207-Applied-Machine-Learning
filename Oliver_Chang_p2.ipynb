    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup posts on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish posts by topics inferred from the text. Whereas with digit classification, where each input is relatively dense (represented as a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero), here each document is relatively sparse (represented as a bag-of-words). Only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The assumption is that a label depends only on the count of words, not their order.\n",

    "Why doesn't Logistic Regression work as well as Naive Bayes does?\n",

    "Produce an improved Logistic Regression model by preprocessing the text. Evaluate and show its f1 score and size of the vocabulary. Try for an improvement in f1 score of at least 0.02.\n",

    "A: In this case, I reduced the vocabulary size from 33291 to 27629. The F1 score improved from 0.7 to 0.72. I generated a preprocessor that eliminates words containing digits, special characters, and shorter than 4 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "One interesting discovery is that if I don’t pass in any preprocessor into the countvectorizer, the size is  26879, However, if I pass in a null preprocessor, the size becomes 33291. I think it’s because the vectorizer generates different features based on different input arguments. \n"

    "### Part 6:\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. Logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small total size. The default L2 regularization computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (as in Part 3 above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. Whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives many of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "For several L1 regularization strengths ...<br/>\n",
    "* Produce a Logistic Regression model using the **L1** regularization strength.  Reduce the vocabulary to only those features that have at least one non-zero weight among the four categories.  Produce a new Logistic Regression model using the reduced vocabulary and **L2** regularization strength of 0.5.  Evaluate and show the L1 regularization strength, vocabulary size, and f1 score associated with the new model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Show a plot of f1 score vs. log vocabulary size.  Each point corresponds to a specific L1 regularization strength used to reduce the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does performance of the models based on reduced vocabularies compare to that of a model based on the full vocabulary?\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "* Train on the transformed training data.\n",
    "* Evaluate on the transformed development data.\n",
    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., penalty=\"l1\")` to produce a logistic regression model using L1 regularization.\n",
    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., penalty=\"l2\")` to produce a logistic regression model using L2 regularization.\n",
    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., tol=0.015)` to produce a logistic regression model using relaxed gradient descent convergence criteria.  The gradient descent code that trains the logistic regression model sometimes has trouble converging with extreme settings of the C parameter. Relax the convergence criteria by setting tol=.015 (the default is .0001)."

    "How is TfidfVectorizer different than CountVectorizer?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: TF-IDF if the short for term frequency–inverse document frequency. It means the vectorizer not only counts the frequency of the words, but also tries to adjust the weights/frequency by comparing the occurrence of the words in the corpus, a huge collection of documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "Produce a Logistic Regression model based on data represented in tf-idf form, with L2 regularization strength of 100. Evaluate and show the f1 score. How is TfidfVectorizer different than CountVectorizer?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: The F1 score using TfidfVectorizer(0.75) is higher than CountVectorizer(0.7). The adjusted counts/frequency of features based on the corpus improved the performance of the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Explain what the R ratio describes. \n",
    "\n",
    "A: The R-ratio describes the ratio between the predicted probability of the model to the 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑜𝑓 the 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡 𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑒𝑙.  This ratio kind of describes how well the model is calibrated, which means how close the predicted probability is to the probability with the correct label.\n",
    "\n",
    "What kinds of mistakes is the model making? \n",
    "\n",
    "A: A lot of cases are misclassified with case 3, religion, especially with case 0, the alt.theism. This part needs more work to differentiate the two topics, since the topics are kind of related . \n",
    "\n",
    "Suggest a way to address one particular issue that you see.\n",
    "\n",
    "A: I would actually combine the two topics in a way since they are close to each other. I will then generate a logistic regression model to differentiate the combined category with the other two, and build another two-class logistic regression model to categorize alt.theism and religion topics. The features should be more differentiable in the second level. \n"
